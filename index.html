        <li> Continue straight.</li>
        <li> Enter through the “Parking” entrance.</li>
        <li> Take a ticket from the machine labeled “Flash.”</li>
        <li>When you see purple color stalls, keep turning right until you reach P3 (Visitor Parking). </li>
        <li>Continue turning right until you arrive here. </li>
        <li> At the screen, find "T1 4403" and I'll open the gate. Once inside, park in any available spot.</li>
        <li> Look for this gate that directs you to resident building, and stand under the red sensor to open the gate.</li>
        <li> Go straight to the door</li>
        <li> Once here, text Min or Matina (Public Wi-Fi is available on P3, so try to get a Wi-Fi and DM)</li>
        <li>When leaving the building, find this validation machine, scan your ticket and you’ll have 20 mins to exit the building. Thanks for coming to the bday party! :)
